    A "feature" is just a string which represents some set of functionality that needs to be disabled, such as "C2D" or "Twin".

    This object has no notion of what it means to "disable" a feature.  That knowledge is handled by stages in the pipeline which might convert
    this operation to a more specific operation (such as an MQTT unsubscribe operation with a specific topic name).

    This operation is in the group of "Iot" operations because disconnecting is a common operation that many clients might need to do.

    Even though this is an "Iot" operation, it will most likely be handled by a more specific stage (such as an IotHub or Mqtt stage).
